<H1>king babor</H1>
<p>If I were a king, I would have become a different personality.<br>
     Because the responsibility of thousands of my subjects would have fallen on my shoulder. A king is like a father to his subjects.<br>
     A king must protect the people living in his kingdom. He must look after their safety, food, education and health.<br>
      A king should levy tax in such a way that the subjects could pay it without much strain on their part.<br>
       As he draws tax, the majority of the money he should spend on their education, sanitary system,<br>
     irrigation system, transport facilities, road, tanks, agricultural land, industry etc. </p>
